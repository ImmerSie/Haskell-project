# Haskell-project
AIP Assessment 2 Functional Language

A simple website to explore the use of Haskell (and Yesod) to develop web applications.

It contains:
- The boilerplate webpage produced by generating the project (at the base url /)
- A page that takes a url parameter and outputs that parameter onto the page (at url /echo/someparam)
- A page that takes a word in an input field and outputs a string of that word, concatenated with the same word backwords (at url /mirror)
- A page that provides the ability to create a blog post (saving it to a database), with the ability to see a list of all blog posts made, and see the details of a blog post by clicking on the list item (at url /blog and url blog/postid)

These were based on a tutorial, which can be found at "https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/yogsototh/a-yesod-tutorial", although a number of adjustments had to be made to adjust for technologies
